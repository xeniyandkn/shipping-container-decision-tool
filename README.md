# Shipping Container Decision Tool

For the assignment, the consider the following questions:

1. What information are you missing in order to start sketching the user interface? If you want to do the whole assignment at once, you will have to give hypothetical answers to the questions asked in this question, in order to move on to questions 2-3 and 4;
2. What "Off The Shelf" tools would you use to quickly output a visualization of the data (both incoming and outgoing from the algorithm)?
3. What would an initial front-end interface look like? Please build a quick mock-up in whatever framework works best for you
4. What would the front-end architecture look like for the full application in production? How would you evolve over time the mockup to the full application?

# Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

# or

```
