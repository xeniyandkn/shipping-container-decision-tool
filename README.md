# The assignment

For the assignment, the consider the following questions:

1. What information are you missing in order to start sketching the user interface? If you want to do the whole assignment at once, you will have to give hypothetical answers to the questions asked in this question, in order to move on to questions 2-3 and 4;
2. What "Off The Shelf" tools would you use to quickly output a visualization of the data (both incoming and outgoing from the algorithm)?
3. What would an initial front-end interface look like? Please build a quick mock-up in whatever framework works best for you
4. What would the front-end architecture look like for the full application in production? How would you evolve over time the mockup to the full application?

# Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# Using

- Next.js React web development framework with server side rendering
- MUI Material UI
- MUI-x Data Grid table https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/layout/
- 
-

# For future considerations

- [i18n](https://www.i18next.com/) for internationalization
- State management tool - React-redux, Mobx or React Context API to manage application state in a predictable manner.
- Implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth) ensures secure access to the application's features and data. This includes login/logout functionality, user registration, and role-based access control.
- The front-end communicates with the backend server via RESTful APIs to fetch data, submit requests, and perform CRUD operations. Axios or Fetch API can be used for making HTTP requests.
- Implement unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the application. Tools like Jest, React Testing Library, and Cypress can be used for testing.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
- Integrate monitoring and analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Sentry) to track application performance, detect errors, and gather insights into user behavior.
- As well as component-based architecture, responsiveness, single page application, etc.
