# Using

- Next.js React web development framework with server side rendering
- MUI Material UI
- MUI-x Data Grid table https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/layout/
- 
-

# For future considerations

- [i18n](https://www.i18next.com/) for internationalization
- State management tool - React-redux, Mobx or React Context API to manage application state in a predictable manner.
- Implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth) ensures secure access to the application's features and data. This includes login/logout functionality, user registration, and role-based access control.
- The front-end communicates with the backend server via RESTful APIs to fetch data, submit requests, and perform CRUD operations. Axios or Fetch API can be used for making HTTP requests.
- Implement unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the application. Tools like Jest, React Testing Library, and Cypress can be used for testing.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
- Integrate monitoring and analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Sentry) to track application performance, detect errors, and gather insights into user behavior.
- As well as component-based architecture, responsiveness, single page application, etc.
